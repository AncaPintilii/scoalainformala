      <p>Way back when, we thought that being on 'the Web' was a novelty.</p>
      <p>Not any more! The Internet is transforming how we communicate and how we do business. You think television was big?? Ain't nuthin compared to this.</P>
      <p>Why should you get online? What opportunities are here now? Well for starters...</p>
      <ul type="circle">
        <li>Increased exposure and name recognition.</li>
        <li>Hyper-develop niche markets... and maybe even develop a few new ones!</li>
        <li>Online catalogs and order forms. Sell your products and services directly over the net.</li>
        <li>Expand your market worldwide... people in Germany need widgets too!</li>
        <li>Lead generation.</li>
        <li>Customer service &amp; support.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>What does it all cost? Not a whole heck of a lot.</p>
      <p>If you have been thinking about hiring a Web Page designer, then give us a little information and get the ball rolling...</p>
